/**
 * This class is used for implementing parallel multistart metaheuristics. It can be used to restart
 * any class that implements the {@link Metaheuristic} interface. A multistart metaheuristic returns
 * the best result from among all of the restarts. In the case of a parallel multistart
 * metaheuristic, the search returns the best result from among all restarts across all threads.
 *
 * <p>There are several constructors enabling different ways to configure the search. You can
 * initialize the search with a combination of a {@link Metaheuristic} and number of threads along
 * with either a {@link RestartSchedule} for the purpose of specifying run lengths for the restarts,
 * or a run length if all runs are to be of the same length. You can also initialize the search with
 * a Collection of {@link RestartSchedule} objects, one for each thread (with number of threads
 * implied by size of Collection. Or you can initialize the search with a Collection of {@link
 * Metaheuristic} objects and a Collection of {@link RestartSchedule} objects (both Collections of
 * the same size). You can also initialize the search with a {@link Multistarter} configured with
 * your restart schedule, along with the number of threads, or a Collection of {@link Multistarter}
 * objects.
 *
 * <p>When calling the {@link #optimize optimize} method, the runLength parameter corresponds to the
 * number of restarts for each of the Multistarter instances, where those restarts will have run
 * lengths determined by the restart schedule specified upon construction. If the {@link #optimize
 * optimize} method is called multiple times, the restart schedules of the parallel metaheuristics
 * are not reinitialized, and the run lengths for the additional restarts will continue where the
 * schedules left off.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of object being optimized.
