/**
 * This class implements first descent hill climbing. In hill climbing, the search typically begins
 * at a randomly generated candidate solution. It then iterates over the so called "neighbors" of
 * the current candidate solution, choosing to move to a neighbor that locally appears better than
 * the current candidate (i.e., has a lower cost value). This is then repeated until the search
 * terminates when all neighbors of the current candidate solution are worse than the current
 * candidate solution.
 *
 * <p>In first descent hill climbing, the search always picks the first neighbor whose cost is lower
 * than the current cost (rather than iterating over all neighbors). If no such neighbor exists, the
 * search terminates with the current solution.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of object under optimization.
